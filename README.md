# EE-Net
## Improving the performance of medical image segmentation with instructive feature learning  

## skin lesion segmentation 

```
We take skin lesion segmentation as an example to introduce the use of our model.Later, we will show the code in detail on five different segmentation tasks.
```

### Data preparation

resize datasets and saved them in .npy format.

```
python data_preprocess.py
```

### Train and Test

Our method is easy to train and test,  just need to run "train_and_test_isic.py". 

```
python train_and_test_isic.py
```
